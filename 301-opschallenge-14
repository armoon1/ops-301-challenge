# Help source chatgpt
# The following code is a simple representation of a Python script that mimics a basic virus.
# The virus searches for Python files in the current directory and its subdirectories,
# checks if they already contain the virus signature, and infects those that do not.
# Additionally, the virus has a trigger to print a message if the current date is May 9th.

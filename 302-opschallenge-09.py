#Create if statements using these logical conditionals below. 
#Each statement should print information to the screen depending on if the condition is met.
# Variables
a = 5
b = 10
# Equals: a == b
if a == b:
    print("a is equal to b")
# Not Equals: a != b
#elif a != b:
#    print("a is not equal to b")
# Less than: a < b
#elif a < b:
#    print("a is less than b")
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
#elif a <= b:
#    print("a is less than or equal to b")
# Greater than: a > b
#elif a > b:
#    print("a is greater than b")
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b
#elif a >= b:
#    print("a is greater than or equal to b")

# If none of the above conditions are met
else:
    print("None of the conditions are met")
